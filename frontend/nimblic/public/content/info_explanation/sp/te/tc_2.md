Text Complexity

### **Text Complexity Analysis in Detail**

Text Complexity Analysis uses the Flesch Reading Ease score to evaluate the readability of text. This score considers factors like sentence length and word complexity.

### **How is the Score Calculated?**

Each text entry is given a score between 1 and 100, based on its reading ease. Higher scores indicate text that is easier to read. The function then averages these scores to give you an overall readability level for your dataset.

### **Applying the Analysis**

This analysis is particularly useful for content creators and educators who want to tailor their writing to a specific audience. It helps in ensuring that the text complexity aligns with the readers' comprehension levels.
