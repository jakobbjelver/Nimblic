Text Complexity

### **What is Text Complexity Analysis?**

Text Complexity Analysis in our app is like a reading difficulty checker. It looks at the text in your data and tells you how easy or hard it is to read.

### **Why is it Useful?**

This feature is great because it helps make sure your text is easy to understand for your intended audience. Whether you're writing for kids, teenagers, or adults, it tells you if your writing fits their reading level.

### **How Does It Work?**

The app uses a special formula called the Flesch Reading Ease score. It gives a score from 1 to 100 for each piece of text. A higher score means the text is easier to read. The app then calculates an average score for all your text.
