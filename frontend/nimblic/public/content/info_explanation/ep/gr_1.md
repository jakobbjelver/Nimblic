### **What is a Correlation Network?**

A Correlation Network in our app is a **visual tool** that shows how different pieces of your data are related to each other. Think of it as a map where each point (node) represents a different type of data, and lines (edges) between them show how closely they are connected. 

### **Why is it Useful?**

This network helps you **see patterns and relationships** in your data that might not be obvious. It's like having a bird's-eye view of your data, helping you understand how different parts influence each other.

### **How The App Creates It**

Our app makes this complex process simple. It takes your data and automatically calculates these relationships, turning them into an easy-to-understand network. You don't have to worry about the math behind it; the app does all the heavy lifting, visually presenting the connections in your data.

**Remember:** This network is a great way to start exploring your data, especially if you're new to data analysis. It's a simple yet powerful way to get insights.
