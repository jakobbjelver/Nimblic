- **Outliers and Bounds:** Identifies numeric values that fall outside the expected range, which could indicate errors or anomalies.
- **Memory Usage:** Monitors the data's memory footprint, essential for optimizing performance.
- **Duplicate Rows:** Detects and counts duplicate entries, which could skew your analysis.
- **Constant Columns:** Finds columns with no variation, which often provide little analytical value.
