Recommended Graphs

### **Algorithmic Insights**

Our `recommend_graphs` function employs a **sophisticated algorithm** to analyze your dataset and suggest appropriate graphs. It considers data types, distribution, and relationships between variables to provide tailored recommendations.

### **Advanced Graph Selection Criteria**

The algorithm goes beyond basic analysis, considering factors like the number of categories, dominance of certain values, and potential correlations. It then suggests graphs like pie charts, radar charts, or bubble charts based on these nuanced criteria.

### **Optimized Data Visualization**

For experts, these recommendations offer a starting point for deeper data exploration. The function's logic ensures that each graph type maximizes the information conveyed, leading to more insightful data analysis.
