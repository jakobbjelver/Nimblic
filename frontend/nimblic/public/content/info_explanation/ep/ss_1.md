### **What is Statistical Analysis in Nimblic?**

The app's statistical analysis feature is like a detective that examines your data. It looks at different types of data - numbers, dates, categories, and more - and tells you interesting facts about them, such as averages, most common values, and unique patterns.

### **Why is it Useful?**

This feature is great because it does all the hard work for you. It can find missing pieces, tell you which numbers are unusually high or low, and even spot special patterns like dates or email addresses in your text data.

### **How Does It Work?**

When you choose a column of data in the app, it automatically figures out what type of data it is and then picks the best analysis for it. If it's numbers, it will tell you things like the average or if there are any unusual values. For text, it might tell you the most common words or if there's a pattern like phone numbers.
