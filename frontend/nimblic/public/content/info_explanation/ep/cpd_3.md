Change Point Detection

### **Algorithmic Depth**

In our application, Change Point Detection utilizes the `ruptures` **library** and the Binseg algorithm. This choice is made for its efficiency in handling large datasets.

The implementation involves fitting the algorithm to a univariate time series, with a **penalty parameter** influencing the balance between the number of breakpoints and fit quality.

### **Significance Calculation**

Change points are identified through segmentation, with significance determined by comparing mean values before and after the point, against the standard deviation. This approach filters out insignificant fluctuations.

### **Graphical Insights**

Our line graph representation offers an **immediate recognition** of these change points, providing a nuanced tool for detailed analysis.
