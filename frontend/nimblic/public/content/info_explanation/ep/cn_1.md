Correlation Network

### **What is a Correlation Network?**

A Correlation Network in our app is a **visual tool** that shows how different pieces of your data are related to each other. Think of it as a map where each point (node) represents a different type of data, and lines (edges) between them show how closely they are connected.  

### **Why is it Useful?**

This network helps you **see patterns and relationships** in your data that might not be obvious. It's like having a bird's-eye view of your data, helping you understand how different parts influence each other.

### **How The App Creates It**

Our app makes this complex process simple. It takes your data and automatically calculates these relationships, turning them into an easy-to-understand network. You don't have to worry about the math behind it; the app does all the heavy lifting, visually presenting the connections in your data.

### **What is Influence?**

In our Correlation Network, **Influence** is like a measure of popularity. It tells you how important or central a piece of data (node) is in the network. A node with high influence has strong connections to many other nodes, making it a key piece in understanding your data.

### **What is Weight?**

**Weight** in a network is like the strength of a friendship. It shows how strong the relationship is between two pieces of data (nodes). A higher weight means a stronger relationship, which is crucial to understand how changes in one part of your data might affect another.

### **What is Degree?**

The **Degree** of a node in a network is the number of connections it has. If a piece of data (node) has many connections (edges) to other nodes, it has a high degree. This tells you how many different pieces of data it's directly related to.

**Remember:** This network is a great way to start exploring your data, especially if you're new to data analysis. It's a simple yet powerful way to get insights.
